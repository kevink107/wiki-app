## OpenAI API Key

Because OpenAI requires a review process for web applications using their API, the site is not currently approved for deployment. 

In the meantime, please visit the following URL to obtain an OpenAI API key, so you can run the program on your own: https://openai.com/api/.

From there, clone the `wiki-app` repository and plug in your API key within the quotation marks on line 8 of `App.js`. 

## Instructions to run

In your command-line window, type the following: 

```bash
npm start
```
